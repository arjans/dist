# dist
Exploring signed distance fields in Racket

This project is a way to easily experiment with signed distance fields, a representation for 3d shapes. You can define functions representing these signed distance fields in Racket, and then render them in the repl using Racket's plot library.

## Installation

1. Download Dr Racket
2. Clone this repo
3. Open "geometry.rkt" in Dr Racket
4. Hit "Run"
5. Enter `(render (sphere 1))` in the repl

## Demo

An upright modeled with dist. See the code for this example in [/examples/upright.rkt](/examples/upright.rkt)
